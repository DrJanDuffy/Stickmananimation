          title: "Deploy ultra-minimal redirect solution"
          body: |
            This PR adds an ultra-minimal redirect solution that should fix deployment issues.
            
            The solution consists of:
            - A simple HTML page with meta refresh and JavaScript redirect
            - A minimal Vercel configuration
            
            Both methods redirect users to the Replit-hosted application.
