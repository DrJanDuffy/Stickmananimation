```md
## Description
<!-- Please include a summary of the change and which issue is fixed. -->

## Type of change
- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)
- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)
- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)
- [ ] This change requires a documentation update

```

### 3. Code Owners

Create a file at `.github/CODEOWNERS`:
```
# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# these owners will be requested for review when someone 
# opens a pull request.
*       @your-github-username

# You can also specify different owners for different paths
# For example:
# /server/   @backend-team
# /client/   @frontend-team
# /docs/     @documentation-team
```

### 4. GitHub Actions Workflows

Create the following files in `.github/workflows/`:

#### CI Workflow (ci.yml)
```yml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [18.x]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        cache: 'npm'
    - run: npm ci
    - run: npm run build --if-present
    - run: npm test --if-present
```

#### Deployment Workflow (deploy.yml)
```yml
name: Deploy to Production

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          
      - name: Build project
        run: |
          npm ci
          npm run build
          
      - name: Deploy to production
        run: echo "Deploy command would go here"
        # Actual deployment command depends on your hosting provider
```

### 5. Security Policy

Create a file at the root called `SECURITY.md`:
```md
# Security Policy

### 6. .gitignore

Create a `.gitignore` file at the root:
```
# Dependencies
/node_modules
/.pnp
.pnp.js

# Testing
/coverage

# Production
/build
/dist

# Misc
.DS_Store
.env
.env.local
.env.development.local
.env.test.local
.env.production.local

# Logs
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*

# Editor directories and files
.idea
.vscode
*.suo
*.ntvs*
*.njsproj

```

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Release Management**: Consider setting up a semantic versioning workflow using GitHub Releases.

2. **Labels**: Configure useful issue labels for your repository, such as:
   - bug
   - enhancement
   - documentation
   - good first issue
   - help wanted
   - question

3. **Project Boards**: Set up GitHub Project boards to track work in progress.

4. **Branch Protection**: Configure branch protection rules for main/master branches to require pull request reviews before merging.

## Migration Steps

When you're ready to push the project to GitHub:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Initialize Git in your local project if you haven't already
3. Add the GitHub repository as a remote
4. Push your code to GitHub
5. Verify that all configuration files are properly recognized by GitHub
6. Set up any secrets needed for workflows in the GitHub repository settings

With these configurations in place, your repository will have a professional structure and workflows to support collaborative development.
