# Deployment Instructions

## The New Strategy

After multiple attempts to deploy the full application on Vercel with persistent issues, we're taking a different approach:

1. **Host the actual application on Replit** (where it's already running perfectly)
2. **Use a simple Next.js app on Vercel** just for the domain and redirection

This approach completely eliminates all the issues with Vercel's handling of our full-stack application while still allowing us to use our custom domain.

## Step 1: Create a New Repository for the Vercel Deployment

1. Create a new GitHub repository (e.g., `stickmananimations-vercel`)
2. Push all the files from the `vercel-app` directory to this repository

```bash
cd vercel-app
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/stickmananimations-vercel.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 2: Deploy to Vercel

1. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and log in
2. Click "Add New" > "Project"
3. Import the GitHub repository you just created
4. Use all the default settings (no environment variables needed)
5. Click "Deploy"

## Step 3: Configure Custom Domain

1. After deployment, go to your project settings in Vercel
2. Navigate to "Domains"
3. Add your custom domain (e.g., `www.stickmananimations.com`)
4. Follow Vercel's instructions to verify domain ownership

## How It Works

- When users visit your custom domain, they are automatically redirected to the Replit app
- The redirection is seamless and quick
- The API requests are proxied through Vercel to the Replit app's API endpoints

## Benefits

- **Simplicity**: No complex configuration or debugging of Vercel's handling of our backend
- **Reliability**: The Replit app is already working perfectly
- **Custom Domain**: You can still use your custom domain for a professional appearance

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the redirection:

1. Check that your Replit app is running and accessible
2. Verify that the URL in `vercel-app/pages/index.js` matches your Replit app URL
3. Ensure your custom domain is properly configured in Vercel
